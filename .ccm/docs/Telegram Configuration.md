Create a new bot with the `/newbot` command of the `@BotFather` Telegram bot.

When you create the bot, BotFather will generate a token for you. You need to copy this token and paste it into the dashboard page where you can configure the package.

Create a new Telegram group and add your newly created bot to it.

Finally, you need to determine the chat ID that identifies the Telegram group.

The easiest way to find it is by using the [Telegram Web App](https://web.telegram.org/):

1. Go to the Telegram group and look at the URL.
2. The chat ID is the number right after the `#` character (note that it can also be a negative number).
